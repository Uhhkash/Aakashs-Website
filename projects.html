              (May 2024 - Nov 2024) I worked witha client and coded a Magic the Gathering inspired 
              web game using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Ably</strong>. 
              Focused on responsive design and meeting all functionality requirements.

              (June 2025 - September 2025) Gathered zip code tabulation polygonal area dataset
              and used <strong>LeafletJS</strong> to create an interactive map for users to input their zip code
              and learn about where there energy is coming from.

              PlanetPatch is a non-profit organization I co-founded with my fellow 
              UW Madison alumni. We received a grant from the city of Madison via the 
              Youth Climate Action Fund. Our work consisted of planting several rain gardens
              around the city of madison. We also created a website which features the climate tracker
              map I created.
